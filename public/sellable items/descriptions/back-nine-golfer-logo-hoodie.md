## Item Details

A soft, mid-weight hoodie built for slow mornings on the course and easy nights after the last putt. This hoodie features a clean, minimal golf-themed logo on the chest that reads "Back Nine Apparel," giving it a quietly confident, club-ready look. The roomy kangaroo pocket and double-lined hood hold tees, gloves, and coffee. Wear it over a polo between rounds, drape it in the clubhouse, or pull it on for a cool evening walk along the fairway - it settles into your routine without shouting. Ethically sourced cotton and durable polyester keep the fabric plush and resistant to shrinkage, while optional embroidery or sleeve prints add a tailored touch for those who like subtle customization.
