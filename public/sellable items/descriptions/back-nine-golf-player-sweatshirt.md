## Item Details

Light, roomy, and quietly confident - this garment-dyed sweatshirt wraps you in the kind of relaxed warmth you reach for after a long round on the course or a crisp morning walk. The subtle vintage wash softens the cotton blend and lets the embroidered golf motif sit like a badge of shared afternoons: wind, focus, and that small triumph when the club meets the ball. It sits loose across the shoulders and tucks in at the ribbed cuffs and hem, so you feel comfortable whether you're layering a flannel over it at the clubhouse or wearing it solo on a cool weekend. Low-impact dyes and a sewn-in twill label give a thoughtfully finished feel that fits into a practical, active wardrobe.

## Product Features
