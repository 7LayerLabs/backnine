## Item Details

A clean, understated tee that lets the logo do the talking. This minimal chest print t-shirt features the Back Nine Apparel golfer motif in a small, tasteful placement that says "I play" without shouting it. The garment-dyed cotton delivers that perfectly broken-in feel from the first wear, while the relaxed fit gives you room to move through your day, whether you're on the course or running errands. It's the kind of shirt that pairs well with everything and gets better with each wash.
